# Overview

This is a full-stack web application, "SafeMode," built with React and Express, featuring a retro desktop-inspired user interface. It utilizes a modern TypeScript stack with shadcn/ui components for the frontend and Express.js for the backend API, integrating with PostgreSQL via Drizzle ORM. The application's purpose is to provide an easy way to build applications using AI agents, offering a decentralized environment for development. It aims to be a comprehensive platform for AI-assisted coding with a unique, nostalgic user experience, and is designed for deployment on platforms like Replit.

# System Architecture

## Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript and Vite.
- **Routing**: Wouter for client-side routing.
- **State Management**: TanStack Query for server state management and caching.
- **UI Components**: shadcn/ui library built on Radix UI primitives.
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom CSS variables for theming, supporting Dark Mode, Retro Mode, and Cypherpunk Mode.
- **Form Handling**: React Hook Form with Zod validation.
- **UI/UX Decisions**: Retro desktop theme ("SafeMode OS") with authentic micro-interactions and "meet your new R&D team." branding. Responsive design with a Linktree-style mobile layout. Theme-specific branding and icons, including a "Agent Launchpad" for app management with toggleable applications and a global theme selector with visual previews. Recent updates include removing extra spacing between app titles and descriptions for tighter visual layout, simplified description text to "Never send a human to do a machine's job. Safe Mode sends a team of AI Agents that work continuously while you sleep to accomplish whatever task you ask them to do. Be nice," unified messaging across all view modes, reduced app button sizes for more compact design, dynamic window sizing (smaller for â‰¤6 apps), running apps tracking system that shows launched applications in the desktop taskbar with click-to-close functionality, countdown timer integration within Credits button, simplified branding from "SafeMode Chat" to "Chat", and payment modal with Credit Card and MetaMask options. Default enabled apps: Claude, Gemini, Visual Studio, Opencode, and Crush only.

## Backend Architecture
- **Framework**: Express.js with TypeScript for the REST API.

## Data Storage
- **ORM**: Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL dialect.
- **Schema**: Includes a User table.
- **Validation**: Zod schemas for runtime type validation.

## Authentication & Authorization
- **Email Signup System**: Simple email capture form that saves to PostgreSQL database
- **Storage Interface**: Abstract IStorage interface with DatabaseStorage for email collection
- **User Management**: Email-based signup system for user registration and notifications

## System Design Choices
- Monorepo structure with shared TypeScript definitions for full-stack type safety.
- Applications are launched via a desktop-like interface with customizable visibility.
- Integrated chat system with typing indicators.
- Global theme selection with visual previews.

# External Dependencies

- **Database**: Neon Database (PostgreSQL).
- **UI Framework**: Radix UI.
- **Build Tools**: Vite (frontend), esbuild (backend).
- **Payment Processing**: Stripe packages configured for credit card payments.
- **Integrated AI Services (examples)**: Claude, Gemini, VSCode, Opencode, Cursor, ChatGPT, Charm Crush (Crush), Add an Agent (feedback form).
- **Authentication**: Email-based signup system for user registration
- **External Links/APIs**: Akash deployment endpoints for Terminal and File Browser, various contact platforms (Discord, Telegram, Signal)

  - Eliminated DesktopWindow component and all related window state management
  - Apps launch with loading animation feedback and open properly in new tabs without blocking issues

# Production Deployment Notes

## Email Signup System Configuration
The email signup system uses a simple PostgreSQL database to store user emails:

**Database Requirements:**
- PostgreSQL database with `emails` table
- DATABASE_URL environment variable properly configured
- Drizzle ORM schema migrations applied (`npm run db:push`)

**Email Collection Features:**
- Frontend email validation with user-friendly error messages
- Backend API endpoint `/api/signup` for email storage
- Toast notifications for successful signups and error handling
- Prevention of duplicate email signups
